## What am I planning on reading for my data science ethics post?

I researched the book "Artificial Unintelligence" by Meredith Broussard and was interested by its premise. Throughout the book she explores how our eagerness to do almost everything digitally has led to poory created systems and produced technology that actually doesn't work. She explores the limits of technology issues a warning that we should never assume that computers always get things right.

## Where am I hoping to get data for my main class project?
I'm looking to find a data set that's practical and has been recently collected. Data that pertains to the environemnt is especially intersting so I'll find my data set on data.gov or from the National Careers from the National Centers for Environmental Information.
