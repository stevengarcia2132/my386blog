## The Story

We live in a world that is focused on itself. People give an appearance of perfection and want others to see their best side. This self-centered mindset has left many misled about where they should put their time and priorities. However, in an increasingly self-centered world a new genre of books has become increasingly popular. Self-help books teach the importance of being self-interested and not self-centered. Being self-interested means you care about your own well-being and improving your character so you can reach your goals. As you become the person you want to be, you naturally want others to become the best version of themselves.

Because of my interest in self-help books, I decided to web scrape the top 207 self-help books from Amazons website. My original question was to see how the price of self-help books was distributed and to see if there was a correlation between the rating and price. I was very surprised with my findings. I discovered that majority of books listed on Amazons website are free with an audible account.

My question shifted to why Amazon was listing so many books as free with an audible account. I did some research and found some surprising figures. Did you know that in 2021 eBook revenue reached $[928](https://goodereader.com/blog/e-book-news/ebook-sales-plummeted-10-4-in-november-2022#:~:text=US%20ebook%20sales%20have%20virtually,a%20total%20of%20%24928.0%20million.) million! Digital audiobooks are the fastest growing segment in digital publishing and their growth is expected to continue in the coming years. As a successful business Amazon is also leading the way by encouraging their users and incentivizing them to subscribe to an audible account.

## The Data

Collecting this data was much more difficult than I had expected, however it helped me refine my coding and debugging skills. I became familiar with html code, Json data structures and the Beautiful Soup package. I used my new skills to create a program that would read in html code and create a Json file with the name, price, rating, number of reviews and image link as a key value pair. After inputting multiple pages of html code I converted my Json files to a python pandas data frame where I began to wrangle and clean the data. I converted columns to the correct types and used regular expressions to clean the rows of extra characters.

With my clean data I was ready to begin my EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). I began by creating various plots revolving around the price of the books. I mainly used the histogram function in the plotly express package to create the visuals. As I was making the plots, I realized I was a bit limited in what I could do. The number of reviews variable was not very helpful in making visualizations. In total I created five plots which helped give me insight into the data.

## Conclusion

Data really does tell a story. If I was casually scrolling through Amazon's website looking at these books, I wouldn't have noticed that most of them are listed as free.

It has been very fulfilling to grow my knowledge about web scraping and python. In the future I know itâ€™s important to have a big picture question in mind so that I can collect meaningful data. Check out my code in my [Github](https://github.com/stevengarcia2132/WebScrape-Amazon) to see what led to my findings.
