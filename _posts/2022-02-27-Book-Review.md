As automation grows, artificial intelligence is having a bigger impact on industries but softwareâ€™s in place are "ethically blind" and don't involve any explicit moral reasoning.
"Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong" is a thought-provoking exploration of the challenges associated with designing machines that make ethical decisions.

## What I liked from Moral Machines
The authors' take an interdisciplinary approach by relying on insights from philosophy, computer science, and engineering to explore the issues associated with developing moral machines. This approach creates a well-rounded view that allows for greater understanding of the big picture issue. Another strength of the book is that they explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner which makes the book accessible to readers with a range of backgrounds. You don't need to be programmer or a philosopher to understand the points that are being made. Throughout the book Wallach and Allen encourage readers to reflect on their own ethical beliefs and values, challenging readers to consider the ethical implications of AI for society.   

## What I didn't like from it... 
Wallach and Allen focus on the big picture issue throughout the entire book. This is great because it allows readers with different backgrounds to understand but they miss opportunities to go into more technical detail. Code snippets or figures of models could have been included to help the reader understand how the decision process works. Readers interested in a more technical perspective on the topic will have to supplement their reading with additional resources. Another point I noticed when reading was that there is no clear solution or recommendation for how to address the challenge. 

## My overall impression and Rating
Overall Moral Machines is a thought-provoking book that will keep the reader engaged with its use of practical applications. The numerous examples of how moral machines are already implemented through self-driving cars to military drones left me thinking what kind of future we will see in the coming years.  Anyone interested in the future of technology and ethical issues will find this book very interesting. I've never read a book like this one and I guarantee anyone will find its contents relevant and intriguing. For this reason, I would rate Moral Machines 5/5.
