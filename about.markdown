I’m from Newport Beach, California and I’m excited to see where my professional journey takes me. I love solving problems through programming and working with others. I’m skilled in R programming and have experience in SQL, Python, and C++. I've worked in the sales industry and I'm looking to apply my communication and technical skills to real-world projects.
